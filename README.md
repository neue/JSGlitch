========

Made this years ago so the code is pretty shambolic, it was just hacked together to use as a filter on a project I was working on back then.

- Offset : Location in the base64 stream where you want to induce an error
- Data : The actual error you're inducing
- Re-Glitch : Add another error
- Random : Add a random error
- Re-Encode : Push the image back through the encoder
- Store : Take a snapshot
